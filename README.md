# Arithmetic Sequence Calculator for the TI-84 Plus CE/CSE
This program can calculate Arithmetic Sequences in the form of "a=d(n-1)+b".

# Installation:
To get this program, you can either send ARISTHEQ.8xp to your calculator using:
  - [TI-Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware) (Windows/MacOS)
  - [Tilp](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tilp/) (Linux)
  - [ticonnectce.latealways.dev](https://ticonnectce.latealways.dev) (ChromeOS)
Or, you could also create a new program on the calculator and copy the code from src(8xp).txt file to the calculator's program editor.

# Running the Program:
Once you have this program on your calculator, go to the program menu , scroll up/down to the program of
your choice.
Then, you press [enter] twice to run it.

# Cemetech Archives
I have submitted this program in the [Cemetech Archives](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads), so for anyone who wants it they can find it [here](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/2607/x3339)

Also, for anyone who found this program here and wants the program **just** for their calculator, you can ignore Arithseq_Python_Port.py. It's just the program ported to Python.
